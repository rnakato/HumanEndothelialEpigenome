## About this project

As a part of the International Human Epigenome Consortium (IHEC) project, 
we collected ChIP-seq data of histone modifications as well as RNA-seq and DNA methylation data from various vascular cell types from multiple donors. To catalogue and characterize the transcriptomic and epigenomic landscape in the vascular system, we implemented comprehensive analysis for genome-wide data of active histone modifications and gene expression for nine types of human endothelial cells show below.

- Human aortic endothelial cells (HAoECs)
- Human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCoAECs)
- Human endocardial cells (HENDCs)
- Human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs)
- Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)
- Human umbilical artery endothelial cells (HUAECs)
- Human common carotid artery endothelial cells (HCCaECs)
- Human renal artery endothelial cells (HRAECs)
- Human great saphenous vein endothelial cells (HGSVECs)
